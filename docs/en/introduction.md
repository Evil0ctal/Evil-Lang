# Introduction to Evil Lang

Evil Lang is a lightweight, expressive interpreted programming language designed for education and learning programming language implementation principles. It combines the best features of imperative and functional programming paradigms while maintaining simplicity and readability.

## Why Evil Lang?

Evil Lang was created with several goals in mind:

1. **Educational Purpose**: To help developers understand how programming languages work internally
2. **Simplicity**: The entire interpreter is implemented in about 1000 lines of Python code
3. **Feature-Rich**: Despite its simplicity, it supports modern language features
4. **Readable Code**: The implementation is clean and well-documented

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables can hold any type of value
- **First-Class Functions**: Functions can be passed as arguments and returned from other functions
- **Closures**: Functions can capture and retain their outer environment
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Support for classes, inheritance, and methods
- **Module System**: Organize code with import/export mechanisms
- **Exception Handling**: Robust error handling with try/catch/finally
- **Unicode Support**: Full UTF-8 support for international users

## Language Philosophy

Evil Lang follows these design principles:

1. **Clarity over Cleverness**: Code should be easy to understand
2. **Explicit is Better**: No hidden magic or implicit behaviors
3. **Learn by Doing**: The best way to understand is to experiment
4. **Gradual Complexity**: Start simple and add complexity as needed

## Who Should Use Evil Lang?

Evil Lang is perfect for:

- **Students** learning about programming language design
- **Developers** interested in language implementation
- **Educators** teaching compiler/interpreter concepts
- **Hobbyists** exploring language design

## What Makes Evil Lang Special?

Unlike other educational languages, Evil Lang:

- Provides a complete, working implementation
- Includes modern features like closures and OOP
- Has excellent error messages with context
- Supports interactive development with REPL
- Includes a growing standard library
